PROJECT :WEATHERFORECAST APP USING HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT

OBJECTIVE :
The Weather Forecast App provides users with real-time weather information and forecasts through a responsive and user-friendly interface, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic and interactive features. It allows location-based weather updates and customizable options to enhance user experience.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
Developing a Weather Forecast App involves several key activities aimed at delivering real-time weather information through a responsive and user-friendly interface. The process begins with planning and designing the app’s structure and user flow. The development environment is then set up with necessary tools and version control. The app’s basic structure is built using HTML, while CSS is used for styling and ensuring responsive design. JavaScript handles dynamic updates and interactive features, including integration with weather APIs and geolocation services. The app undergoes thorough testing and debugging across different browsers and devices, followed by optimization for performance and deployment to a hosting platform. Continuous maintenance and updates ensure the app remains functional and user-centric.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

1.HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

For structuring the content of the app and ensuring semantic markup for better accessibility and SEO.
2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

For styling and layout of the app, creating a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.
3.JavaScript:

For adding interactivity, handling dynamic content updates, and integrating with external APIs.
4.Weather API:

A third-party service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit) to fetch real-time weather data and forecasts.
5.Geolocation API:

To access the user's current location and provide location-based weather updates.
6.Version Control (Git):

For tracking changes in the codebase, collaboration, and maintaining project history.

7.Responsive Frameworks (optional):

Frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for easier and faster development of responsive designs.
These technologies collectively ensure the app is functional, interactive, responsive, and capable of delivering up-to-date weather information to users.
